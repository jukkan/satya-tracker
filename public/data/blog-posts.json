    "excerpt": "Satya Nadella discusses how 2026 will be a pivotal year for AI, moving from discovery to diffusion phase. He emphasizes the need to stop obsessing over model quality and start thinking about systems, getting beyond \"slop vs sophistication\" debates.",
    "summary": "Nadella proclaims 2026 as AI's pivotal year, shifting from discovery to diffusion. He argues the industry should move beyond model quality debates and focus on building practical systems, transcending the 'slop vs sophistication' dichotomy with a new framework for AI deployment.",
    "ai_analysis": "Ah yes, Satya launching a personal blog to tell us that arguing about AI quality is so 2025. Nothing says 'I'm totally not defensive about Copilot criticism' quite like starting a 'scratchpad' to explain how everyone else is thinking about AI wrong. Microsoft's CEO is essentially creating a director's commentary track for his company's AI strategy—because apparently quarterly earnings calls weren't intimate enough.",
    "ai_predictions": "Expect this blog to become required reading for Microsoft employees, complete with weekly quizzes. By Q2 2026, we'll see 'systems thinking' mentioned in every Microsoft product announcement, replacing 'AI-powered' as the company's favorite buzzword. The blog's RSS feed will mysteriously become a default bookmark in Edge browser.",
